**HOICA**
====================================

Hoica is an acronym for "Houston Open Innovation Crowdsourcing Application". We plan on creating just that. A crowdsourced, open community where Houstonians can share their ideas, questions, and requests with one another and *hopefully* with city council. This will implement a voting system where users can vote on other users posts in order to insure that the highest quality posts will be seen.
