**HOICA**
====================================

Hoica is an acronym for "Houston Open Innovation Crowdsourcing Application". We plan on creating just that. A crowdsourced, open community where Houstonians can share their ideas, questions, and requests with one another and *hopefully* with city council. This will implement a voting system where users can vote on other users posts in order to insure that the highest quality posts will be seen.


To start a localhost server using MAMP:
------------------------------------------

Go into your applications folder and find the MAMP folder. Not the software itself, but the actual folder. Inside that folder there will be another folder called "htdocs". Put your "hoica" folder into htdocs.

Once you start MAMP, there will be 3 options: Preferences, Open Start Page, and Start Servers.

Click on start servers. Your browser will open with the server information. Type "localhost:8888" into your browser for the URL. This will be a very plain, dry, html-only page. Click "htdocs". From there you just click on "hoica", and the page should start running smoothly. 

To speed things up, you can bookmark [this](http://localhost:8888/htdocs/hoica/), because it will automatically take you to the project as long as your servers are up and running.
